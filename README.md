# Traffic condition and air quality

This code is aim to get traffic data in real time via Google´s API and relate the traffic condition with air quality using machine learning.
Rigth now,the code generates a sequense of trips a long a road of interested in order to get the average speed in real time in different sections of the street using the Google maps´s API. Nowadays, the code is limited to this point. However, is still under development a second part of the taks realted to the match of this data with meteorological and pollutant data in order to generate analysis, and predcition of air quaility in areas already cover by monitoring sensors and areas where there are not sensors.
